/**
 * B2Capabilities provides constants capabilities in application keys.

 * DESIGN NOTE: It is *not* an enum because new capabilities will be added
 *              over time and we want code to be able to get a key from
 *              the service and use the list of capabilities to create a new
 *              key with the same capabilities. operation.  If we used an enum,
 *              even with the BzJson.defaultForInvalidEnumValue() annotation,
 *              we wouldn't be able to operate generically on keys with unknown
 *              capabilities.
