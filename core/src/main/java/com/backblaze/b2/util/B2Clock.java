/**
 * This class provides access to two different time measurements.
 *
 * It also provides access to the global clock object.  It's an object
 * instead of static methods so we can use a different implementation
 * in tests.
 *
 * It is an abstract class instead of an interface so that it can hold the
 * global instance. (If we had a dependency injection system we would
 * probably use that instead of a global, but we don't have one.)
 *
 * I also keep thinking that maybe there should be two different types
 * of clock objects -- one for monotonic time and one for wall clock time.
 * So far, I'm keeping them together because it helps to advance them
 * both in tests and every call to get a value says what type of time it is.
